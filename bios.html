		 			<p class="bandPos">Singer/SongWriter</p>
		 			<p>Jack was born in Kansas City and first got into music when he saw his first concert with his mom, Alkaline Trio.  Two years later, he picked up his first guitar and didn't practice much to his father's lament.  It wasn't until he started singing that he found his passion.  Playing in a few local bands in high school and college, it wasn't until his senior year that he realised finance wasn't for him and formed the band Saltblossom.</p>
